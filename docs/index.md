## How It's Made?
This website is based on a collection of calculated recipes stored in a
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/jhermann/ice-creamery#readme).

```

The recipes are written as *LibreOffice* spreadsheets, which allows to directly
use formulas for the calculation of important ice cream metrics and nutritional information.

A Python script then converts CSV exports of the spreadsheets to markdown files, which are in turn used to render this HTML web site using
[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

## General Recipe Hints

 1. Most of the recipes here can be put back into the freezer after processing, and remain scoopable for days without processing them again. Plan ahead accordingly.

    Another advantage of such recipes is you can do the processing during the day, and enjoy your ice cream in the evening or at night without disturbing anyone with *Creami* noises.

    Or, if you prefer soft-serve consistency, you can dig in immediately.

 1. Recipes are optimized for flavor and texture, not for the number of ingredients. If you use a kitchen scale and immersion blender, this workflow makes the number of ingredients not that important:

    * Put the tub on the scale and weigh the wet ingredients one after another using TARA, and the same for the dry ones into one additional bowl.
    * Then pour the dry stuff into the wet stuff and blend away.

 1. Ingredient amounts fit the 720ml (24oz) container size of the *Creami Deluxe*. For the base model and the *Swirl*, scale the recipes by using â…” of all ingredients (66%).

 1. Some of the recipes have 'Mix' in their name. These are partial recipes where you can weigh a mix of most or all of the dry ingredients in bulk.

    You typically prepare enough for 5-10 tubs, making the overall process more efficient. Ingredients that only need small amounts are also easier to weigh, due to the upscaling for several portions.

    When you make the final base, you weigh that mix, making it easier to use only a kitchen scale.
