# What's this?
This website is based on a collection of calculated recipes stored in a
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/jhermann/ice-creamery#readme).

The recipes are written as *LibreOffice* spreadsheets, which allows to directly
use formulas for the calculation of important ice cream metrics and nutritional information.
