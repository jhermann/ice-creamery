# About
A collection of my Ninja Creami recipes; the goal is to have only tested / approved ones,
but on the way there [draft](https://jhermann.github.io/ice-creamery/tags/#tag:draft) recipes
are tagged as such.
Most recipes are formulated so that they also work in a classic churning machine.

It currently has `{{ path(config.docs_dir).glob('?/*.md') | list | length }}` recipes.

## How It's Made?
This website is based on a collection of calculated recipes stored in a
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/jhermann/ice-creamery#readme).

```

The recipes are written as [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download-libreoffice/)
spreadsheets, which allows to directly use formulas for the calculation of
important ice cream metrics and nutritional information.

favicon: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhermann/ice-creamery/refs/heads/main/assets/libre-office-favicon.ico
```

A Python script then converts CSV exports of the spreadsheets to markdown files, which are in turn used to render this HTML web site using
[MkDocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs#readme).
