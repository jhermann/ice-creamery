## How It's Made?
This website is based on a collection of calculated recipes stored in a
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/jhermann/ice-creamery#readme).

```

> ðŸ’¡ You can load <a href="/ice-creamery/print_page/" target="_blank">all pages at once<sup>â†—</sup></a>
> to save the site as stand-alone HTML or PDF.

The recipes are written as *LibreOffice* spreadsheets, which allows to directly
use formulas for the calculation of important ice cream metrics and nutritional information.

A Python script then converts CSV exports of the spreadsheets to markdown files, which are in turn used to render this HTML web site using
[MkDocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs#readme).
