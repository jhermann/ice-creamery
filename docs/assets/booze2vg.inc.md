!!! tip "Alcohol Replacement"

    If you don't want alcohol in your ice cream, or prepare it for kids, replace the small amount of
    {{ 'alcohol' | ingredient }} in non-boozy recipes with
    {{ 'vegetable glycerin (E422)' | ingredient }}.
    For 10g booze (40 vol%) use 8g VG instead,
    in addition to any VG already part of the recipe.
