!!! tip inline end "Weighing Small Quantities"

    To properly weigh small amounts of special ingredients like gums without a jeweller's scale,
    mix them with 9 times inulin or another filler (10g gum, 90g inulin).
    Then use 10g of that blend to get 1g of the gum.
    These amounts work on any half-decent kitchen scale, both while preparing and using the mix.

    To get an even mix, progressively add the inulin, i.e. start with a 1:1 ratio of gum and filler, mix,
    then add more and more inulin while mixing, until you reach the target weight.
