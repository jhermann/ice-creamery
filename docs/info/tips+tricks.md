# Tips & Tricks

## General Recipe Hints

 1. Most of the recipes here can be *put back into the freezer* after processing, and *remain scoopable for days* without processing them again. Plan ahead accordingly.

    Another advantage of such recipes is you can do the processing during the day, and enjoy your ice cream in the evening or at night without disturbing anyone with *Creami* noises.

    Or, if you prefer soft-serve consistency, you can dig in immediately.

 1. Recipes are *optimized for flavor and texture, not for the number of ingredients*. If you use a kitchen scale and immersion blender, this workflow makes the number of ingredients not that important:

    * Put the tub on the scale and weigh the wet ingredients one after another using TARA, and the same for the dry ones into one additional bowl.
    * Then pour the dry stuff into the wet stuff and blend away.

 1. Ingredient amounts fit the 720ml (24oz) container size of the *Creami Deluxe*. For the base model and the *Swirl*, scale the recipes by using ⅔ of all ingredients (66%).

## Prepared Dry Mixes
Some of the recipes have 'Mix' in their name. These are partial recipes where you can weigh a mix of most or all of the dry ingredients in bulk.

You typically prepare enough for 4-10 tubs, making the overall process more efficient. Ingredients that only need small amounts are also easier to weigh, due to the upscaling for several portions.

When you make the final base, you weigh that mix, making it easier to use only a kitchen scale, most of which are not that precise with low amounts.

## Scrape Test, Always

*Always* perform a [scrape test](https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjacreami/comments/1hvk23j) before processing,
to judge what mode fits the specific tub before you best,
and whether you should leave the tub on the counter for 5 to 15 minutes to make it soft enough for processing ('soft' still means frozen here, just less so).

When soft enough, scrape down any hump that might have developed during freezing, to get a paddle-friendly flat surface.

## Handling of Icy Sides & Bottom

The way a *Creami* processes your base means that the tub sides and bottom remain partially frozen, since the paddle can *never* touch the sides or bottom of the container, within normal operating conditions.

To fix that, **after** the 1st (main) processing step, run *cold* tap water (20..25°C) over the container, while turning it to treat the container wall fully. Do that for 15..30 seconds, depending on the consistency of the base.

Then, for already relatively soft bases, do a 2nd run on "Mix-in" to minimize the additional heat induced, otherwise perform a "Respin."

> ⛔ It is *not* recommended to use hot water *before* the 1st (main) processing step! You risk your machine since the frozen block can get loose and spin within the tub, with commonly catastrophic consequences (burn-out of the machine, shearing of the rod tip and paddle).
