## Dextrose Equivalent (DE)

A measure of the amount of reducing sugars present in a sugar product, expressed as a percentage on a dry basis relative to dextrose (percentage of glucose molecules in dry matter).

The dextrose equivalent gives an indication of the average degree of polymerisation (DP) for starch sugars. As a rule of thumb, `DE × DP = 120`.

## Potere Anti Congelante (PAC)

PAC is the same as FPDF but includes lactose, which constitutes 54.5% of MSNF. Typically SMP (skimmed milk powder) contains 97% MSNF, so 53% of lactose.

The PAC method should be used when lactose concentration significantly varies or is high enough to make the ice cream too soft.

*Total FPDF:* Sum of (weight[g] * specific FPDF) over all sweeteners (in 100g ice cream mix).

 Ice cream stored at -18°C with a total FPDF of 20..25 will be easily scoopable, while <15 will be quite hard. Ice cream is considered soft enough when about 65% of the water molecules are frozen at serving temperature (e.g. -11°C).

 For milk ice cream, target range is 24-28 (double the serving temp, i.e. 2*-12°C), for sorbets 30-36 (factor 2.5).

## Synergistic Interaction Gels (SIGs)

The interaction of specific thickeners can lead to the formation of gel networks,
which influences the texture and mouth-feel of ice cream. 
These gels influence ice crystal formation by capturing water molecules,
and also can simulate the presence of missing fat.

SIGs are typically more potent and sometimes have new characteristics compared
to the isolated use of their components.

A typical example is the combination of LBG and XG.
