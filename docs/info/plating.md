## Select a Dish and Spoon

You need to decide on form, material, and color of your ice cream vessels. Bowls, glasses, plates all work â€” if you add fruit and other toppings or sides, plates offer enough room for that.

The double-walled glass (usually intended for hot tea) is a nice option for smaller portions without many toppings
â€” it isolates your scoop and does not provide much heat of its own, so melting is very slow.

Refrigerate your dishes one hour or more before serving, to avoid unnecessary melting.

## Scoop Your Ice Cream

### The 'Melon Ball' Technique

This works for firmer consistencies and directly out of a Creami tub.
Use your scoop or spoon and turn it vertically in a circle, carving out a ball (or possibly egg) of ice cream.

It works well for left-overs or making many scoops, because you can reach deep into the container easily.

### Forming Quenelles

Quenelles are easy to do with a little practice, you just need a spoon with a nice oval head. It is best suited for softer consistencies.

ðŸ’¡ You might need to tilt your Creami tub when it's not filled to the rim, so you can reach deeper into it with your spoon.

* [Mix-ins and Toppings](/ice-creamery/info/ingredients/#mix-ins-and-toppings) in the info section

If you have sprinkles, chocolates shaving, or similar, it's advisable to drizzles or pour some 'glue'
over your scoops, in the form of sauces or thick syrups.
