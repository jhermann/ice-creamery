<!--
1. git log --since="3 months ago" --pretty=format:"%H %ad %s" --date=short --numstat recipes >history.txt
2. add "history.txt" as a source to NotebookLM (via "Upload")
3. paste the prompt:

use the "history.txt" source which has this format: records are lines separated by an empty line;
1st line is Commit SHA, Commit date, and Commit message;
the other lines hold the number of added and deleted lines for each file changed in the commit,
which can be used to infer the changeset size, followed by the path of the file.

create a bullet list of the names of the directory under "recipes" for all changes of "README.md" files
that have at least one record with more than 40 lines added. sort the list by the date in descending order,
and include the date as the first field, in bold text.
leave out the text " (Deluxe)" in the visible directory name.
link the directory name using Markdown format, with the URL prefix
"/ice-creamery/" followed by the first letter of the name as a 2nd path component,
and finally followed by the FULL original directory name. url-encode that link.
put the number of added lines into a HTML comment after the link, in the format "added NNN lines".
