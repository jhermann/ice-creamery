# Ingredients

Here you can find some background information about common ingredients in ice cream recipes.

## Freezing Point Depression Factors

Freezing point depression factor (FPDF) of common ingredients:

 * Sucrose (1:1 glucose:fructose) / Lactose / Polydextrose 1.0
 * Ethanol 7.4 (40vol% booze 2.96)
 * Salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) 5.9
 * Vegetable glycerin 3.7 (sweetness=60%; GI=5)
 * Erythritol 2.8
 * Xylitol 2.2
 * Allulose / Fructose / Dextrose / Invert sugar / Sorbitol / Honey 1.9
 * Agave Syrup 1.8
 * Glucose Syrup (42 DE) 1.29
 * MC corn starch 0.5
 * Glucose Syrup (28 DE) 0.5
 * Maltodextrin (18 DE)	0.34 (other sources: 1.29)
 * Inulin 0.1 (other sources: 0.25)

 Ultra-sweet fluids (sucralose, stevia/steviol, monk fruit) have no effect
 on the freezing point, since they lack the necessary mass.
 If in powdered form, make sure the bulking agent has no effect
 – quite often erythritol is used since it adds no calories.


## Sweeteners

### Allulose

Using it as a single sweetener in ice cream results in a poor texture,
only use in combination with e.g. erythritol.

### Erythritol (E968)

Sugar alcohol with a cooling mouth-feel and about 75% as sweet as sugar (add ⅓ when swapping). Erythritol is non-caloric.

Erythritol lowers the freezing point of water drastically (2.8x compared to sugar).

It has a strong tendency to crystallise in long-term frozen state (weeks), leading to a hard texture. This can be alleviated by adding at least 0.05% of a stabilizer, and staying below 8% of total weight.
Mixing with at least 40% of xylitol has the same effect.

*Dosage:* 6.5-8% of an ice cream base.

### Inulin

Inulin is a naturally occurring polysaccharide, and used to improve mouthfeel, stability, acceptability of low-fat ice creams, and forms a gel-like network that binds water. Add 10-20g to a 720g mix.

RDA is 8-18g (tested for up to 24 weeks). Most common side effects include gas, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, and cramps. As a fructan, inulin has minimal impact on  increasing blood sugar.

Natural chicory / agave inulin has 8g sugar, and 88% fiber. Further processing leads to HP inulin that has 97% fiber and 0% sugar, and it needs to be heated to 65°C to dissolve.

### Stevia (E960)

Stevia is a natural, calorie-free sweetener derived from the leaves of the *Stevia rebaudiana* plant, native to South America. The leaves contain compounds called steviol glycosides, which are significantly sweeter than sugar (around 200-400 times sweeter).

Many people find stevia to have a slightly bitter or licorice aftertaste.

In ice cream, stevia in its pure form (as a liquid) makes it simple to dial in the sweetness of a base without influencing its texture and PAC value.

### Sucralose (E955)

Sucralose is a non-caloric artificial sweetener that is about 600 times sweeter than table sugar.
It is derived from sucrose through a chemical process.
Sucralose is commonly known by the brand name Splenda.

Like stevia, when used in liquid form, it makes it simple to dial in the sweetness of a base without influencing its texture and PAC value.

### Vegetable Glycerin / Glycerol (VG / E422)

Glycerin, also known as glycerol or E422, is widely used in ice cream to reduce the hardness of the frozen base.
It is a sugar alcohol and has one of the highest freezing point depression factors, at 3.7 compared to table sugar.

It is a clear, odorless, and sweet-tasting liquid with a syrupy consistency.

*Vegetable* glycerin is typically made from plant oils like soybean, coconut, or palm oil.
It has 60% the sweetness of table sugar, and is hygroscopic.
Shelf life of glycerin is 24 months when stored below 100°F in a closed container.

*Dosage:*  Add 5-15g to a 720g mix.

Glycerin serves several key purposes in ice cream:

 * *Anti-freeze and Anti-crystallization:* This is its primary function. Glycerin helps to prevent the formation of large, hard ice crystals, which can make ice cream feel icy and less creamy. By lowering the freezing point of water and retaining moisture, it ensures a smoother, more scoopable texture, even at very low freezer temperatures. This is particularly beneficial for homemade ice cream, or for ice creams that are refrozen.
 * *Humectant:* It acts as a humectant, meaning it helps to retain moisture. This contributes to the overall texture and prevents the ice cream from drying out or becoming too hard.
 * *Emulsifier:* Glycerin can help oil and water-based ingredients mix more effectively, improving the stability and consistency of the ice cream.
 * *Sweetener:* While it has a mild sweetness (about 60-75% as sweet as sugar), its sweetening power in the small amounts used in ice cream is often negligible compared to its other functional benefits. It's also considered a sugar substitute with a lower glycemic index.


### Xylitol (E967)

Sugar alcohol which is as sweet as sugar at 236 kcal (sugar: 405 kcal).
It has a low glycemic index, so only count 35-40% for net carbs.

Xylit has no daily intake limits defined, but consuming smaller amounts
of 5-10g over a day is recommended, due to the effects on the digestive system.


## Thickeners

[Thickeners (E4xx group)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_number#E400%E2%80%93E499)
are texturizing agents and natural hydrocolloids to stabilize, thicken, gelify, emulsify, or bind liquids (water).

Most thickeners are hydrocolloids, which are hydrophilic molecules that have a high molecular weight. They are used as functional ingredients in food formulation for increasing food consistency, improving gelling effect, and controlling the microstructure, texture, flavor, and shelf life.

Many thickeners also have an emulsifying effect.

### Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC / E466)

CMC is used to stabilize and improve the texture of ice cream. It's a thickening agent and emulsifier that helps prevent ice crystals from forming, resulting in a smoother, more scoopable ice cream. It can also improve the ice cream's resistance to melting, keeping it firmer for longer.

Combine it with GMS (emulsifier), in a 7:1 to 4:1 ratio (up to 1% of water content; typically 0.3% GMS and 0.05–0.15% CMC).

*Also know as:* cellulose gum / Tylo / Tylose / Blütenpuder.

### Guar Gum (E412)

Guar gum is a binding agent which combines favorably with LBG or XG. If combined with XG, use a 4:1 ratio (GG:XG). If replacing XG, use 3 parts GG for 2 parts of XG (3:2 ratio).

For hydration, heat it to 80°C, or let it soak for a few minutes. Guar gum can withstand 80°C for a few minutes, beyond that point it degrades and looses effectiveness.

*Dosage:* Use 0.1% … 0.3% in ice cream (max. 1.5%). It creates a creamy mouth feel, and can replace milk or cream powder. Tara gum can replace guar gum.


### Locust Bean Gum (LBG / E410)

LBG is a vegetable-based hydrocolloid extracted from the seeds of the carob tree.
It's a galactomannan polysaccharide, meaning it's made up of sugar molecules (galactose and mannose).

It serves as a thickening agent, stabilizer, and emulsifier.
LBG has a high viscosity, transparency and brightness.
It is synergistic when combined with other hydrocolloids to increase their gelling properties.

 * *Dosage:* 0.15% … 0.75% of liquid (combined with other ingredients)

   * 0.4% for desserts
   * Prevents boil-over of pie fruit filling (0.1…0.3%)

 * Fully hydrated at 90°C, gels at about 85°C.
 * Combine with xanthan for a cold gel.
 * Combine with agar to get a less brittle / more elastic gel.
 * Stabilizes ice cream, combined with guar and/or CMC.

*Also know as:* carob / Johannisbrotkernmehl.

### Tara Gum (E417)

In ice cream, it creates a creamier, richer mouth feel than guar gum.

*Dosage:* 0.05-0.15% for ice cream, sorbet and sherbet

### Xanthan Gum (XG / E415)
[Xanthan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthan_gum) works at room temperature. To easily mix it with water, dissolve in some oil or mix with other dry ingredients first. For liquids, always use a blender or immersion blender.

Combine it with LBG for a cold gel. At certain ratios, like 7:3 LBG to XG, the synergistic effect is maximized, resulting in a harder gel. Heating can facilitate the formation of the gel network.

## Emulsifiers

### Glycerol Monostearate (GMS / E471)

Glycerol Monostearate (GMS) is an emulsifier, and also a thickening and anti-caking agent. In ice cream, it adds body and helps to create a smooth texture (by reducing ice crystal formation), and prevents it from drying out or being too sweet.

GMS takes the form of a white, odorless, and sweet-tasting flaky powder that is hygroscopic.
It's the result of a chemical reaction of glycerol with stearic acid,
both typically refined from plant or animal sources.

Due to its low HLB value of around 3.8–5.4, to incorporate GMS into a water-based solution,
it can be first mixed with oil and then blended into the water phase (similar to xanthan).

GMS is typically used at concentrations of 0.1% to 0.5% of the total mix.
When used with CMC, typical ratios go from 2:1 to 7:1 (GMS:CMC).
