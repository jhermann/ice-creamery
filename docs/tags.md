# Tags<img style="float: right; margin-left: 1.5em;" width=160 alt="Logo" src="../assets/logo-tags.png" />

Tags are keywords used to describe and categorize the recipes,
mostly based on traits of the ingredients they use.

Some tags probably need an explanation:

 * [Draft](#tag:draft) marks recipes that are incomplete, or not tested yet.
 * [Promising](#tag:promising) recipes showed to be viable, but have potential to be improved.
 * [Favorite](#tag:favorite) are *my* favorites. YMMV, but if you're new here, it is a good pre-selection.
 * [Light](#tag:light) recipes have an energy value of at most 75 kcal/100g.
 * [Scoopable](#tag:scoopable) recipes are guaranteed freezer-stable due to a PAC value of at least 30.
 * [Polysaccharide Gum](#tag:polysaccharide-gum) contain one of LBG, xanthan, guar or tara gum.
 * [Alcohol](#tag:alcohol) only marks explicitly 'boozy' recipes; many others contain small amounts of pure ethanol (typically 4g) to help with [Freezing Point Depression](../info/glossary/#freezing-point-depression-factor-fpdf).

Ask a notebook at https://notebooklm.google.com/
with "all-recipes" as the source (see `recipes/README.md` for that).

List ALL recipes below 75kcal, with just their name and energy, sorted by energy.
Energy values are listed for each recipe in a list item starting with "Nutritional values per 100g/ml",
in the "NUTRITIONAL & OTHER INFO" section.
leave out the text " (Deluxe)" in the visible recipe name.
link the recipe name using Markdown format, with the URL prefix
"/ice-creamery/" followed by the first letter of the name as a 2nd path component,
and finally followed by the FULL original recipe name.
url-encode that link. so to reiterate, the links have the markdown format
"[shortened recipe name](url-enconded full recipe name)".
