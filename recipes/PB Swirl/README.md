# INGREDIENTS

  - _70ml_ Cream 32% â€¢ Use coconut or soy cream to keep this vegan!
  - _20g_ PB powder
  - _10g_ Xylitol â€¢ POD = 100%; GI = 7
  - _0.25g_ Salt â€¢ 5-7 shakes

# DIRECTIONS

1. Put ingredients into a bowl, and stir with a spoon until smooth.

1. Make *several* small holes in your processed base, using the blunt end of a chopstick.
The base should not be too soft for this.
Place one hole in the center and 6 to 8 holes in a circle.

1. Then fill those holes with the cream/PB mix, and use the pointy end of a chopstick
to *carefully* fold the base and the swirl into each other, without mixing.

1. This is best done by slowly moving the chopstick in a circle,
sticking it diagonally into the base, while also slowly turning the tub until you did a full circle.

1. Refreeze for at least a few hours.
