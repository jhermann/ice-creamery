# INGREDIENTS

  - _70ml_ Cream 32%
  - _20g_ PB powder
  - _10g_ Xylitol • POD = 100%; GI = 7
  - _0.25g_ Salt • 5-7 shakes

# DIRECTIONS

 1. Put ingredients into a bowl, and stir with a spoon until smooth.<>
 1. Make *several* small holes in your processed base, using the handle of a cooking spoon. The base should not be too soft for this. Place one hole in the center and 6 to 8 holes in a circle.
 1. Then fill those holes with the cream/PB mix, and use the pointy end of a chopstick to *carefully* fold the base and the swirl into each other, without mixing.
 1. This is best done by slowly moving the chopstick in a circle, sticking it diagonally into the base, while also slowly turning the tub until you did a full circle.
