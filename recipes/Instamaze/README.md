⚠️ **Work in progress!**
> *Unsweetened* pre-mixed starchy stabilizer for Ninja Creami recipes.

It takes handling small amounts of ingredients and their ratio to each other
out of the process of mixing your final ice cream base,
making the overall process less finicky.

To prepare the mix, take a **BIG** bowl like used for baking, measure the ingredients on a scale,
and whisk them carefully but thoroughly. A ball whisk works best.
When done, store the powder in an air-tight container with enough volume.

> **3 Ingredient Replacement**<br />In a pinch, you can replace one 15g dose of the mix by 1.5g guar, 0.5g xanthan, and 0.5g salt — scale other amounts accordingly.
> Do not expect the exact same results as from the full blend.

Adding bulk to the thickeners prevents clumping when blending them into your base.
Drizzle the mix into the vortex of a running blender,
or drop it into your mixing container and quickly integrate it with an immersion blender on full speed.
Before that, combine this mix with any granulated sweetener or other dry / powdery ingredients you have.

Use 25g of the mix for a Creami Deluxe tub (24oz, yields 12),
and 17g for the regular size (16oz, yields 18).

The salt is added for convenience with final recipes,
and for a FPDF boost. Inulin and the starch bulk up the mix to be compatible with normal kitchen scales.

 1. Pour into the tub and *QUICKLY* use an immersion blender on full speed to homogenize everything.
 1. Let blender run until thickeners are properly hydrated, up to 1-2 min. Or blend again after waiting that time.

 1. Process with RE-SPIN mode when not creamy enough after the first spin.
