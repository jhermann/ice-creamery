# DIRECTIONS

 1. **Mix cornstarch slurry**: In a small bowl, whisk the cornstarch with a few tablespoons of the milk until smooth.
 1. **Heat base**: In a saucepan, combine the remaining milk, corn syrup, sugar, and salt. Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat.
 1. **Thicken**: Stir in the cornstarch slurry and simmer for 1–2 minutes until slightly thickened.
 1. **Add cream cheese**: Remove from heat and whisk in the softened cream cheese until fully incorporated.
 1. **Chill**: Cool the mixture quickly (ice bath or fridge) until completely cold — ideally overnight.
 1. Put on the lid, freeze for 24h, then spin as usual. Flatten any humps before that.
 1. Process with RE-SPIN mode when not creamy enough after the first spin.
