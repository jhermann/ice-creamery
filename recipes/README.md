    list all recipes below 75kcal/100g, with just their name and energy

And the answer is this:

> Based on the nutritional information provided in the sources, here are the recipes with a nutritional value below 75 kcal per 100g/ml:
> 
> * **Vanil-Low (Deluxe)**: **59.9 kcal/100g/ml**

To actually load the recipes into *NotebookLM*, you need to provide them in text format.
Use this command in a shell while you are in the `recipes` folder:

    head -9999 */README.md >all-recipes.txt

The resulting file `all-recipes.txt` can now be uploaded as a text source into your notebook.

## Updating automatically generated tags
Updating auto-tags includes adding new ones created by additional code,
but also removing them when based on metrics that are no longer true (PAC, energy values).

Use this command in the `recipes` directory:

    for i in */Ice-Cream-Recipes.csv; do \
        ( cd "$(dirname "$i")"; ice-cream-recipe.py -E --tags; echo; ) \
    done

Then review with `git add -p`, commit, and push.
