## Chopped Nuts
Nuts are a nice addition to many flavors,
and can be used as a mix-in or as a topping.

Most of the time, it's sensible to not keep them whole,
with the exception of small ones like peanut halves or pine nuts.
So chop or crumble them. You can also buy them ready to use,
e.g. sliced almonds (topping) or almond slivers (mix-in).

All nuts are hard enough to keep some integrity if used as a mix-in.
And their fat content prevents them from going frozen solid.

Roast or caramelize nuts to get a different flavor profile.
