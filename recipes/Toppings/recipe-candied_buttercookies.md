<img style="float: right; margin-left: 1.5em;" width=240 alt="Logo" src="logo-candied_buttercookies.png" />

Candied buttercookies or graham crackers, glazed with molasses and isomalt.

Isomalt, a sugar alcohol derived from beet sugar, provides a crisp texture and mild sweetness
while maintaining a glossy finish that resists moisture. Its low glycemic index keeps the
sugar added to the cookies in check.

> ⚠️ Molten isomalt is dangerous and can *severely burn* you, so be vigilant.<br clear=all />

 3. Pour the isomalt into a small flat container (ideally only a bit larger than the cookies), and coat each cookie with isomalt, using the molasses as the glue.
 4. Put the cookies on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper, or onto a silicone / BBQ mat.
 5. Bake at 170°C for 11–15 minutes, until all crystals are molten.
