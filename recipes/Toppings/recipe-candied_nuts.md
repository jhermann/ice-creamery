Candied nuts made with isomalt offer a lower-calorie, tooth-friendly alternative
to traditional sugar-coated varieties.

Isomalt, a sugar alcohol derived from beet sugar, provides a crisp texture and mild sweetness
while maintaining a glossy finish that resists moisture. Its low glycemic index makes these treats
suitable for low-carb diets.

*Directions*

> ⚠️ Molten isomalt is dangerous and can *severely burn* you, so be vigilant.

 1. Preheat your oven to 170°C (340°F).
 1. *Optionally* break the nuts into smaller but uniformly sized pieces.
 1. Rinse the nuts shortly under running water, and drain the excess.
 1. Put them into a medium-sized bowl, drizzle the molasses over the nuts, and mix with a spoon to coat all pieces equally well.
 1. Sprinkle the isomalt crystals and salt over the nuts, and mix again for uniformly covering everything.
 1. Put the nuts in a single layer on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper, or onto a silicone / BBQ mat.
 1. Bake at 170°C for 13–17 minutes, until all crystals are molten.
 1. Let the nuts cool down and harden, check the temperature for below 40°C with an infrared thermometer.
 1. Store in an air-tight container, in the freezer.
