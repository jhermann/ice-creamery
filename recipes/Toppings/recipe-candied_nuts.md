Candied nuts made with isomalt offer a lower-calorie, tooth-friendly alternative
to traditional sugar-coated varieties.

Isomalt, a sugar alcohol derived from beet sugar, provides a crisp texture and mild sweetness
while maintaining a glossy finish that resists moisture. Its low glycemic index makes these treats
suitable for low-carb diets.
