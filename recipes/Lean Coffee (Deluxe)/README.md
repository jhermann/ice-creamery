# Lean Coffee (Deluxe)

A version of “Coffee & Cream” with calories reduced by about 30%

Spun on Sorbet, followed by a scrape-down and a re-spin.
Went to the freezer again for an hour to firm up.

The coffee flavor is there but not dominant,
the consistency is soft and from experience will get a bit firmer after several hours in the freezer.

Rating: 😋😋😋😋☕

# DIRECTIONS

 1. Add "wet" ingredients to empty Creami tub.
 1. Weigh and mix dry ingredients, easiest by adding to a jar with a secure lid and shaking vigorously.
 1. Pour into the tub and *QUICKLY* use an immersion blender on full speed to homogenize everything.
 1. Let blender run until thickeners are properly hydrated, up to 1-2 min. Or blend again after waiting that time.
 1. Add remaining ingredients (to the MAX line) and stir with a spoon.
 1. Put on the lid, freeze for 24h, then spin as usual. Flatten any humps before that.
 1. Process with RE-SPIN mode when not creamy enough after the first spin.
