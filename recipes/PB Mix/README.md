Counting the pre-made mix as one, it is a 7 ingredients recipe for the final base, including the water.

Use ~125g of the mix in your final base (or 85g for a regular 16oz tub).
Process on Light Ice Cream, then fill the center hole with the crumbled strawberry slices and mix-in.
Freshly mixed in they add a crunch, when stored a while in the freezer they re-hydrate and get chewy.

To make your life easier, take the ‚Äúprep‚Äù ingredients times 4, mix them,
and store in an air-tight 1l or 1.3l container (1l is the minimum you need for 500g powder).
To mix, take a BIG bowl like used for baking, measure the ingredients,
and whisk them carefully but thoroughly. A ball whisk works best.
