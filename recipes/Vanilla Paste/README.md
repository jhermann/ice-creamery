# Vanilla Paste

Making your own luxurious vanilla bean paste at home easily surpasses store-bought options and elevates your ice cream making skills.
This easy recipe uses readily available ingredients, including vanilla beans of varying quality.
The process involves simmering, blending, and yields a versatile paste for sweet and savory dishes.
The result is superior to typical vanilla extracts or essences, especially when compared to “cheap, artificial” supermarket versions.

The vanilla beans your use can be grade B, preferably with some residual moisture.
Besides the beans, you need water, sugar, and a small amount of corn syrup
to prevent crystallization when storing the paste over a longer time,
and to also increase viscosity.

For the sugar component, prefer monosaccharides such as glucose, fructose, lactose, maltose, trehalose, plus (rice /corn) syrup and the like.
The main reason to not use sucrose is a lower GI or PAC, for health reasons and easier recipe balancing, respectively.
Trehalose is used here because of its lower GI and sweetness, but feel free to simply go with table sugar and corn syrup.

Make sure that all the equipment you use is thoroughly cleaned and sterilized, to ensure
a long shelf life of several months, when kept in the fridge. Pay special attention to
the container you’ll store it in.

Also do not waste what is left in your sieve, but dry the residue and grind it down in a food processor.
The powder can then be used to improve the taste of breakfast bowls and the like.
