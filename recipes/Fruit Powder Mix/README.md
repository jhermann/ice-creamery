# Fruit Powder Mix (Deluxe)

Spun in Light Ice Cream mode, plus a mix-in run with 10g freeze-dried strawberry slices.
Comes out as soft-serve, I put it back into the cold for 45min for a firmer consistency.

This one is a favorite, so it gets its own recipe mix for convenient indulgence…
It works for fruit or root powders with a sugar content from low (Ube, 10%) to high (Lingonberry, 73%).
Counting the pre-made mix as one, it is a 6 ingredients recipe for the final base, including the water.
Use ~110g of the mix in your final base (or 72g for a regular 16oz tub).

To make your life easier, take the “prep” ingredients times 4, mix them,
and store in an air-tight 1l container (the powder has a low density and needs space).
To mix, take a BIG bowl like used for baking, measure the ingredients,
and whisk them carefully but thoroughly. A ball whisk works best.
