# Shregg (Deluxe)

Egg liqueur ice cream.

Process on SORBET.

You can also use Baileys at 17 vol%, which bumps up
the energy to 421 kcal. And I’d use 3g GMS due to higher fat content.

# INGREDIENTS

ℹ️ Brand names are in square brackets `[...]`.

**Wet**
  - _420ml_ Water
  - _175ml_ Egg Liqueur 15 vol% [Bols Advocaat] • 1 bottle = 700ml
  - _100g_ Cream Cheese 23% [Exquisa]
  - _5drops_ Flavor drops Vanilla [IronMaxx]

**Dry**
  - _20g_ Inulin [Vit4ever] • Sweetness = 8%; GI ~= 0

# DIRECTIONS

 1. Add "wet" ingredients to empty Creami tub.
 1. Weigh and mix dry ingredients, easiest by adding to a jar with a secure lid and shaking vigorously.
 1. Pour into the tub and *QUICKLY* use an immersion blender on full speed to homogenize everything.
 1. Let blender run until thickeners are properly hydrated, up to 1-2 min. Or blend again after waiting that time.
 1. Put on the lid, freeze for 24h, then spin as usual. Flatten any humps before that.
 1. Process with RE-SPIN mode when not creamy enough after the first spin.
