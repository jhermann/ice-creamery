Use 20g *Ube Yam Root powder* instead of the vanilla
for a different taste and color, and with 7 kcal/100g more.

Or 20g Strawberry powder and strawberry flavor drops
instead of the vanilla ones (same caloric impact).

If you have access to it (North America), you can use 40g Allulose as sweetener,
instead of the sugar alcohols and for 4 kcal/100g less.
