# S&S Light (Deluxe)
<img style="float: right; margin-left: 1.5em;" width=240 alt="Logo" src="logo-s+s-light.png" />

Adapted Salt & Straw's base, scaled to ~600g neutral base and targeted for less fat (8%) and sugar (2%) with 3.4% net carbs.

Use the 80–100g unclaimed tub space for a flavor component of your choice,
either blended into the base before freezing, or added as a mix-in later on.

The example recipe as found below is flavored with strawberries (fresh/frozen + freeze-dried for a flavor boost)
and the 1st test batch was done with blueberries (which was what I had at hand).

Process on *Light Ice Cream*, scrape-down, and then a mix-in or respin as needed.

# DIRECTIONS

 1. Add "wet" ingredients to empty Creami tub.
 1. Weigh and mix dry ingredients, easiest by adding to a jar with a secure lid and shaking vigorously.
 1. Pour into the tub and *QUICKLY* use an immersion blender on full speed to homogenize everything.
 1. Let blender run until thickeners are properly hydrated, up to 1-2 min. Or blend again after waiting that time.
 1. Add remaining ingredients (to the MAX line) and stir with a spoon.
 1. For better results, let the base age in the fridge (covered, lid on), for a few hours or over night. This helps flavor development and gum hydration, especially with unheated bases.
 1. Freeze for 24h with lid on, then spin as usual. Flatten any humps before that.
 1. Process with RE-SPIN mode when not creamy enough after the first spin.
 1. Process with MIX-IN after adding mix-ins evenly. For that, add partial amounts into a hole going down to the bottom, and fold the ice cream over, building pockets of mix-ins.
