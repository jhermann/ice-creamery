# Almond Milk Mix

Prepared mix of ‘flavor-free’ dry ingredients for bases using almond milk.

This yields ten 50g servings intended for a Deluxe recipe, in total 500g.

If you use low-cal flavoring, the resulting base typically ends up at 50..55kcal / 100g energy.

If you have access to it (North America), you can use 400g Allulose as sweetener,
instead of the sugar alcohols and for 4 kcal/100g less.
