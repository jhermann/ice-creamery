# Piña Colada Cocktail (Deluxe)

A *Piña Colada* is a sweet, creamy, tropical cocktail made with rum, coconut cream (or coconut milk),
and pineapple juice, often blended with ice to create a slushy texture, though it can also be shaken.

Originating in Puerto Rico, its name means "strained pineapple" in Spanish, and it's known for its
'summer vacation' flavor, typically garnished with a pineapple wedge and a maraschino cherry.

*Cream of Coconut* is similar to sweetened condensed milk.
