Process on SORBET and MIX-IN or RE-SPIN (choose depending on consistency you get after processing, and eventually want after 2nd spin).

You can vary by replacing SMP ‚Üí whey, and replace the banana by other fruit, e.g. strawberries.
Both variants were good, I liked the whey/strawberry one a little better.
