# Mandarin Sherbet (Deluxe)
<img style="float: right; margin-left: 1.5em;" width=240 alt="Logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhermann/ice-creamery/refs/heads/main/assets/orange-ice-cream-logo.png" />

Mostly mandarin slices and juice, which means a relatively high sugar content, but still reasonably lo-cal because it has only 2% fat.

Small ice crystals (but then it is a sorbet / sherbet), and still immediately scoopable after 1 day in the freezer.

# DIRECTIONS

 1. Add "wet" ingredients to empty Creami tub.

 1. Pour into the tub and *QUICKLY* use an immersion blender on full speed to homogenize everything.
 1. Let blender run until thickeners are properly hydrated, up to 1-2 min. Or blend again after waiting that time.
 1. Add remaining ingredients (to the MAX line) and stir with a spoon.

 1. Process with RE-SPIN mode when not creamy enough after the first spin.
