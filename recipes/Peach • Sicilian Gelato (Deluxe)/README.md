# DIRECTIONS

 1. Add "wet" ingredients to empty Creami tub.
 1. Weigh and mix dry ingredients, easiest by adding to a jar with a secure lid and shaking vigorously.
 1. Pour into the tub and *QUICKLY* use an immersion blender on full speed to homogenize everything.
 1. Transfer the blended base into a saucepan, cook it on medium heat while stirring, to a temperature of around 95°C (203°F) or until it thickens.
 1. Blend the ‘Fill to MAX’ ingredients in the now empty tub, and combine with the cooked pudding. Cool down in the fridge before freezing.
 1. Put on the lid, freeze for 24h, then spin as usual. Flatten any humps before that.
 1. Process with RE-SPIN mode when not creamy enough after the first spin.
