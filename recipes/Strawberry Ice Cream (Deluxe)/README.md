# Strawberry Ice Cream (Deluxe)

Processed on Lite Ice Cream directly from the freezer,
filled the hole with crumbled dried strawberry slices,
and worked them in via a mix-in run.

Intense flavor, very creamy, dense and free of ice crystals,
with a nice crunch from the mix-in.

Rating: 😋😋😋😋😋

# DIRECTIONS

 1. Add "wet" ingredients to empty Creami tub.
 1. Weigh and mix dry ingredients, easiest by adding to a jar with a secure lid and shaking vigorously.
 1. Pour into the tub and *QUICKLY* use an immersion blender on full speed to homogenize everything.
 1. Let blender run until thickeners are properly hydrated, up to 1-2 min. Or blend again after waiting that time.
 1. Add remaining ingredients (to the MAX line) and stir with a spoon.
 1. Put on the lid, freeze for 24h, then spin as usual. Flatten any humps before that.
 1. Process with RE-SPIN mode when not creamy enough after the first spin.
