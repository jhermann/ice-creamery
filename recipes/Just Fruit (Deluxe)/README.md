# Just Fruit (Deluxe)

Sorbet mostly from fresh / frozen fruit, with minimal additions to make it processable (soft, scoopable).

> üåø **Vegan & Dairy-free**

Note that strawberries, with their relatively low sugar content, are well suited for this.
So are many types of melon.

You can reduce the amount of fruit and replace it by water to get better macros (lower carbs / sugar).
That needs compensation for the removed sugar though, replace with
trehalose (same amount as the removed fruit sugar, but it has a way lower GI),
alcohol 40 vol% (half the amount of ‚Äòlost‚Äô sugar), or more sugar alcohols (also half the sugar amount).

*Example:* Just 300g strawberries and 5g more sugar alcohols has 231 kcal and 30g net carbs.

Spin on ‚ÄúSorbet‚Äù, scrape down, and re-mix.

# DIRECTIONS

 1. Add "wet" ingredients to empty Creami tub.
 1. Weigh and mix dry ingredients, easiest by adding to a jar with a secure lid and shaking vigorously.
 1. Pour into the tub and *QUICKLY* use an immersion blender on full speed to homogenize everything.
 1. Let blender run until thickeners are properly hydrated, up to 1-2 min. Or blend again after waiting that time.
 1. Add remaining ingredients (to the MAX line) and stir with a spoon.
 1. Put on the lid, freeze for 24h, then spin as usual. Flatten any humps before that.
 1. Process with RE-SPIN mode when not creamy enough after the first spin.
