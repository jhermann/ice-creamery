Freshly mixed in they add a crunch, when stored a while in the freezer they re-hydrate and get chewy.</p> <p>To make your life easier, take the \u201cprep\u201d ingredients times 4, mix them, and store in an air-tight 1l or 1.3l container (1l is the minimum you need for 500g powder). To mix, take a BIG bowl like used for baking, measure the ingredients, and whisk them carefully but thoroughly. A ball whisk works best.</p> <p>Serves: 4 tubs         Total: 434 g         Per tub: 109 g          </p> <ul> <li>120 g Xylitol</li> <li>100 g PB powder [Vilgain]</li> <li>80 g Skim Milkpowder 1:10 [Vita2You]</li> <li>60 g Whey protein Vanilla [MaxiNutrition]</li> <li>60 g Inulin [Vit4ever]</li> <li>4 g Salt</li> <li>6 g Tylose powder (E466 / CMC) [GoodBake]</li> <li>4 g Guar gum (E412)</li> </ul>","tags":["Dairy","Draft","Fruit","Hi-Protein","Low-Fat","Low-Sugar","Polysaccharide Gum","Scoopable","Sucralose","Tylo Powder (CMC)","Xylitol"]},{"location":"P/PB%20Mix/#ingredients","title":"INGREDIENTS","text":"<p>\u2139\ufe0f Brand names are in square brackets <code>[...]</code>.</p> <p>Prep</p> <ul> <li>30g Xylitol<sup>\u2197</sup> \u2022 Sweetness = 100%; GI = 7</li> <li>25g PB powder [Vilgain]</li> <li>20g Skim Milkpowder 1:10 [Vita2You]<sup>\u2197</sup></li> <li>15g Whey protein Vanilla [MaxiNutrition]<sup>\u2197</sup></li> <li>15g Inulin [Vit4ever]<sup>\u2197</sup> \u2022 Sweetness = 8%; GI ~= 0</li> <li>1g Salt</li> <li>1.5g Tylose powder (E466 / CMC) [GoodBake]<sup>\u2197</sup></li> <li>1g Guar gum (E412)<sup>\u2197</sup></li> </ul> <p>Wet</p> <ul> <li>275ml Skim Milk 1.5% [Weihenstephan]<sup>\u2197</sup></li> <li>150ml Water</li> <li>100g Cottage Cheese 4% [REWE Bio]</li> <li>20g Glycerin (E422, VG) [hd-line]<sup>\u2197</sup> \u2022 Sweetness = 60%; GI = 5</li> <li>15g Brandy \u201cWilliams Birne\u201d 40 vol%<sup>\u2197</sup></li> <li>7 drops Flavor drops Vanilla [IronMaxx] \u2022 with sucralose</li> </ul> <p>Fill to MAX</p> <ul> <li>51.5ml Water to MAX line</li> </ul> <p>Mix-ins</p> <ul> <li>10g Strawberry slices freeze-dried [EWL] \u2022 Mix-in for a full tub (2 servings)</li> </ul>","tags":["Dairy","Draft","Fruit","Hi-Protein","Low-Fat","Low-Sugar","Polysaccharide Gum","Scoopable","Sucralose","Tylo Powder (CMC)","Xylitol"]},{"location":"P/PB%20Mix/#directions","title":"DIRECTIONS","text":"<ol> <li>Add \"wet\" ingredients to empty Creami tub.</li> <li>Add the prepared dry ingredients, and blend QUICKLY using an immersion blender on full speed.</li> <li>Add remaining ingredients (to the MAX line) and stir with a spoon.</li> <li>Put on the lid, freeze for 24h, then spin as usual.

Their primary functions include:</p> <ul> <li>Reducing Ice Crystal Size: Preventing the formation of large, noticeable ice crystals, which can make ice cream feel \"icy\" or \"gritty.\" As one source explains, \"good ice cream has lots of tiny little ice crystals throughout and they're so small that your tongue can't pick them out and gives you a nice creamy texture.\" Stabilizers help maintain these small crystals, especially during freeze-thaw cycles that occur when ice cream is stored in a frost-free freezer.</li> <li>Reducing Air Bubble Size: Contributing to a smoother, creamier texture by ensuring smaller, more evenly distributed air bubbles within the ice cream. This is often achieved by increasing the viscosity of the base.</li> <li>Improving Smoothness and Creaminess: Directly enhancing the mouthfeel and overall palatability of the ice cream.</li> <li>Slowing Melt Rate: Making the ice cream melt more slowly and evenly.</li> <li>Controlling Free Water: Stabilizers \"stabilize the free water\" in the ice cream, preventing it from forming large ice crystals and contributing to an overly cold sensation.</li> <li>Increasing Viscosity: A more viscous base can lead to smaller air bubbles and a richer mouthfeel.</li> <li>Aiding Overrun: While home machines typically yield lower overrun, certain stabilizers can help \"increase your overrun which will give you a slightly lighter ice cream.\"</li> </ul> <p>Natural vs. \"E-Numbers\": There is a common misconception that stabilizers are unnatural. However, the majority of ice cream stabilizers are natural products, derived from \"Beans, they come from seaweed, they come from plants, they come from fruit.\" The \"E-number\" classification (e.g., E412 for guar gum, E410 for locust bean gum) is a regulatory system for additives to allow for a concise ingredient label and database, not an indication of artificiality.</p>"},{"location":"info/polar-ice-creamery/#practical-application-and-considerations","title":"Practical Application and Considerations","text":"<ul> <li>Starting Point: For most stabilizers, begin with a small amount, typically \"0.1 percent of your base mixture.\" Measuring light amounts requires small scales.</li> <li>Combining Stabilizers: Many stabilizers work synergistically. For example, guar gum and locust bean gum combine effectively for both viscosity and ice crystal reduction.

Instead, use the same mode you used originally.</p> <p>However, for bases using a recipe with enough anti-freeze agents in them, this is not necessary. They can be scooped either directly out of the freezer, or after a short period of softening on the counter (the same is true for many commercial ice cream brands).</p> </li> <li> <p>Do not add raw pineapple to your uncooked bases when they contain dairy, since that quite likely causes your ice cream to taste bitter. Since the Creami is very often used with cold bases, this generic problem can appear more frequently than in \"classic\" ice cream making. Complete inactivation of the responsible enzyme requires temperatures around 80\u00b0C (176\u00b0F). Canned pineapple is safe.</p> <p>The science behind it is an enzyme called bromelain, which can react with the proteins (casein) in dairy products like milk or yogurt, causing them to break down into bitter-tasting peptides. Bromelain is found primarily in pineapple, but kiwi, mango, and guava contain trace amounts of it, too.

Cleaning by hand, if you do it regularly, is over in a minute or so.</p> <p>Later, clean the lid by lifting it out of the water and shaking it horizontally, repeating the submerging and lifting+shaking cycle several times. You can also hold it under the running tap, the good hole for running water through the lid is the rectangular one in the lever.</p> <p></p> <p>Finally, shake every drop of water out of the lid, and let it dry in a rack. Keep a firm grip when doing that (don't drop the lid).</p> <p></p> <p>Also, take out the gasket from time to time (at least once a month), and clean it and under it. When ice cream overflowed the rim, do that immediately. Do not overstretch the gasket when removing, cleaning, and putting it back. If you have problems removing the gasket, use a blunt instrument like the top end of a spoon to lift it up.</p>"},{"location":"info/tips%2Btricks/#remotely-monitor-your-freezer","title":"\ud83e\udd13 Remotely Monitor Your Freezer","text":"<p>Freezers, especially auto-defrosting ones, do strange things.

Needs \"normal\" ratios of sugar and fat.</li> <li>Lite Ice Cream: Similar to Ice Cream, but optimized for lower-fat bases, with higher spin speeds and slower movement. Often used for milk alternatives and protein shakes.</li> <li>Sorbet: Fast rotational speed of the downwards movement to prevent large ice crystals from forming, creating a smooth, icy texture.

Do that for 15..30 seconds, depending on the consistency of the base.</p> <p>Then, for already relatively soft bases, do a 2nd run on \"Mix-in\" to minimize the additional heat induced, otherwise perform a \"Respin.\" You can also scrape down the sides with a spoon (upside of the spoon oriented towards the wall) or a stiff silicone spatula, to bring the icy parts to where the paddle can reach them.</p> <p>If your ice cream gets too soft that way, put it back into the freezer for at least an hour.
